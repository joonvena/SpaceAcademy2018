huntBegins
Suddenly, the loudspeakers on the walls sound a blaring alarm! BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! The sound of hydraulics hissing somewhere within the walls is deafening. Simultaneously, something large and sinister stirs somewhere near and lets out a loud, high-pitched screech. Whatever it was, it didn't sound friendly. The hunt is on!

doctor's log #1
"There's something moving in the ventilation system. It sounds like an animal, but I have a bad feeling about this. It seems to be capable of anticipating our actions... as though it were... intelligent."
.
.
doctor's log #2
"A few of our people have disappeared. We only found blood stains and pieces of their clothes. The creature appears to have long claws with which it can rend skin and flesh as though it were just paper. I've told everyone to arm themselves. I suspect a flamethrower would be very useful against the creature."
.
.
doctor's log #3
"We managed to hurt it, but a few minutes later, it attacked us again, bearing no signs of damage from our previous encounter with it. "
.
.
doctor's log #4
"I've collected more samples and data about the creature. It is extremely dangerous. If it were to reach the surface of Earth, our human race - indeed all life as we know it - would soon become extinct."
