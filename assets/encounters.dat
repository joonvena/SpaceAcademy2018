huntBegins
Suddenly, the loudspeakers on the walls sound a blaring alarm! BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! The sound of hydraulics hissing somewhere within the walls is deafening. Simultaneously, something large and sinister stirs somewhere near and lets out a loud, high-pitched screech. Whatever it was, it didn't sound friendly. The hunt is on!

doctor's log #2
"A few of our people have disappeared. We only found blood stains and pieces of their clothes.
