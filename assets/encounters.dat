Hot steam is leaking into the access corridor ahead. Looks dangerous, I'd better not go there until I've fixed the problem!

huntBegins
Suddenly, the loudspeakers on the walls sound a blaring alarm! BLEEP! BLEEP! BLEEP! The sound of hydraulics hissing somewhere within the walls is deafening. Simultaneously, something large and sinister stirs somewhere near and lets out a loud, high-pitched screech. Whatever it was, it didn't sound friendly. The hunt is on!

It's a green-and-gray polymer jumpsuit that kept you nice and comfy while you took a cryogenic nap. Type "drop jumpsuit" if you want to be naked! (Come on, don't be weird!)

fumble
You fumble around while babbling incomprehensibly. You lose time, which is the only thing worth a damn in this life. Maybe next time you'll think about what you will use or take or where will you go to?
